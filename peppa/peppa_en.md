==Episodes==
The following tables list with details the episodes for the children's television programme ''Peppa Pig'', which were first broadcast in the UK on [[Five (channel)|Channel 5]] and [[Nick Jr.]], starting in 2004. Each episode is approximately five minutes long, except for a 10-minute "Special" (''"Peppa's Christmas"'') and two 15-minute "Specials" (''"The Golden Boots"'') and (''"Around The World with Peppa"''). This list also includes upcoming episodes.

The "DVD reference" column in the episode lists is used to relate an episode to the DVD volume(s) on which it can be found (e.g. episode 10 in series 1 "Gardening" has a DVD reference of 1.09, which indicates that the episode is track 9 on primary DVD volume 1). A prefix of "NP" (e.g. NP1.01) indicates the episode is the first episode on "Non-Primary" DVD 1.
